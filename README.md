# Homomorphic-Encryption-Decryption-with-Strings

This repository contains an [updated version of the original code](https://github.com/bit-ml/he-scheme) by Madalina Bolboceanu ([@mbolboceanu](https://github.com/mbolboceanu)).

## Overview

This code demonstrates an updated version of a homomorphic encryption/decryption scheme. It allows you to perform operations on encrypted data while preserving privacy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher is required.
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeByAidan/Homomorphic-Encryption-Decryption-with-Strings.git
   cd Homomorphic-Encryption-Decryption-with-Strings
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Run the `main.py` script to see an example usage of the updated homomorphic encryption/decryption scheme:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script demonstrates encryption, decryption, and operations on encrypted data using the "updated scheme".
